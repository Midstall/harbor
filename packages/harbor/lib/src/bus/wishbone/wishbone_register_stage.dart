/// A one-deep, protocol-correct register slice for a classic Wishbone link.
///
/// It flops the whole request forward (CYC/STB/WE/ADR/DAT_MOSI/SEL) and the
/// whole response back (ACK/DAT_MISO/ERR), so no signal crosses the slice
/// combinationally. That splits the long master -> arbiter -> decoder -> slave
/// -> back combinational path in two, which is the interconnect's clock-speed
/// limiter on a dense fabric.
///
/// Classic Wishbone is not pipelined, so one transfer is outstanding at a time.
/// The slice captures a request only while idle, holds STB to the downstream
/// slave until the slave's ACK, then pulses ACK upstream for one cycle. That
/// costs two extra clock cycles per transfer, which is negligible next to the
/// core's cycles-per-instruction.
///
/// Interfaces: `up` is a consumer (it takes the master-side request and drives
/// the master-side response) and `down` is a provider (it drives the request
/// toward the decoder/slave). Interpose it between the fabric master (or the
/// arbiter) and the decoder.
