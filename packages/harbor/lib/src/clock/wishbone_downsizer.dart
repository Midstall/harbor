/// Single-outstanding Wishbone data-width downsizer (2:1).
///
/// Presents a WIDE Wishbone B4 slave (e.g. 64-bit) and drives a NARROW Wishbone
/// B4 master (e.g. 32-bit) on the same clock, turning each wide transaction into
/// two sequential narrow ones: the low half at the request address, the high
/// half at address + [narrowBytes]. Reads assemble `{high, low}`. Writes split
/// `dat_w`/`sel` into their low and high halves.
///
/// Why this exists: the DDR3 controller's datapath is natively 32-bit (one
/// 32-bit word per BL8-selected burst access). On a 64-bit core bus a 64-bit
/// access (every RV64 instruction fetch is a 64-bit read) would otherwise drop
/// its upper half. This bridge lets the proven 32-bit DDR datapath serve a
/// 64-bit bus, one half-word at a time, with no change to the silicon-calibrated
/// PHY. Latency doubles for DDR-backed access, which is negligible next to DRAM
/// latency and the read-burst already on the wire.
///
/// Single-outstanding: the master holds cyc/stb until ack on each half, drops it
/// for the ack cycle, then re-asserts for the second half, so a downstream
/// single-outstanding slave (the DDR bus face, optionally behind the CDC bridge)
/// sees two cleanly separated transactions.
