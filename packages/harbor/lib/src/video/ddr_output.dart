/// A 1:2 gearing DDR output register, written in plain logic.
///
/// Every FPGA family has a hard cell for this ([Ecp5Oddrx1f] on Lattice,
/// [XilinxOddr] on Xilinx 7 series), and a build for a real part must use that
/// cell, because only the cell can put the register in the pad. Those cells are
/// black boxes with no body, so a simulation cannot run them. This module is
/// what a simulation build uses instead.
///
/// It is deliberately vendor neutral. A simulation of a Xilinx design must not
/// pull in a Lattice primitive to stand in for a Xilinx one, because that hides
/// which part the design is for and puts a cell in the netlist that the part
/// does not have.
///
/// Gearing: BOTH inputs are captured on the RISING edge of [clk]. [q] then
/// shows [d0] while [clk] is high and [d1] while [clk] is low, so the output
/// changes two times per clock period from logic that runs on one edge only.
/// Capturing [d1] on the falling edge instead sends the wrong bit, because the
/// source register has already moved on by then. That fault shows as a
/// scrambled data stream, not as an error, so it is easy to miss.
///
/// The output delay of a real pad is not modelled. No cycle level simulation
/// can see it.
