/// Gather-order guard for the DLL-on trainable ECP5 DQS read (issue: the
/// 144MHz DLL-on read was BEAT-SCRAMBLED: a written 5A5A5A5A read back as
/// A5975210 at every tap). Root cause: the old bitslip was a same-cycle 4-way
/// rotation of the current sclk cycle's four Q sub-beats, which can only permute
/// WITHIN one cycle and can never realign a burst whose beat0 fell in the
/// previous cycle. The fix (litedram ecp5ddrphy.py L376-400) replaces it with a
/// single BitSlip that slides a window across the {prev4, cur4} 8-beat history,
/// i.e. an 8-position rotation: aligned[p] = hist8[(slp + p) % 8].
///
/// This test rebuilds EXACTLY that rotation permutation in isolation (the
/// IDDRX2DQA Q outputs are SystemVerilog-leaf X in sim, so the full PHY read
/// cannot be co-simulated, but the fabric rotation is plain combinational logic
/// and IS sim-visible). It locks in the gather order: for every bitslip 0..7 and
/// every requested word 0..3, the two beats that land in the fabric word are the
/// correct pair from the rotated 8-beat burst, and the packing half-order
/// (packWord = [evenBeat, oddBeat].swizzle, the HW-verified within-word order)
/// is preserved.
